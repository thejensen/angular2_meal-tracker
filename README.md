## Description

_**If you're interested in keeping track of your meals, their calories, and sorting your meals by caloric intake, this is the app for you.**_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_To run app locally:_
_In terminal, navigate to your desktop and execute the following. Feel free to copy and paste the following commands into your terminal:_

* git clone https://github.com/thejensen/angular2_meal-tracker
* cd angular2_meal-tracker
* npm install
* bower install
* gulp build
* gulp serve

## User Stories

* I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
* I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
* I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
* I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).

## Known Bugs

_If you fill out a new meal form without calories, the form will submit without them._
